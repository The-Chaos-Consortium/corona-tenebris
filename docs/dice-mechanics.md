# Task Resolution

The core mechanic uses 2d6 + Characteristic + Skill against a target difficulty.

## Basic Task Resolution

!!! tip "Quick Reference"
    **Basic Task**: 2d6 + Characteristic + Skill â‰¥ Target Number

### Difficulty Numbers

| Difficulty | Target Number | Description |
|------------|---------------|-------------|
| Simple     | 2+           | Almost always succeeds |
| Easy       | 4+           | Usually succeeds |
| Routine    | 6+           | 50/50 chance |
| Average    | 8+           | Moderately difficult |
| Difficult  | 10+          | Challenging |
| Very Difficult | 12+      | Very challenging |
| Formidable | 14+          | Extremely difficult |
| Impossible | 16+          | Nearly impossible |

### Advantage and Disadvantage

=== "Advantage"

    When you have **Advantage** on a task:
    
    - Roll 3d6 and keep the highest 2
    - Circumstances favor the character
    - Superior equipment or preparation
    
    !!! example "Advantage Examples"
        - Using superior equipment (+1 die)
        - Ideal conditions (+1 die)
        - Extensive preparation (+1 die)

=== "Disadvantage"

    When you have **Disadvantage** on a task:
    
    - Roll 3d6 and keep the lowest 2
    - Circumstances work against the character
    - Poor equipment or conditions
    
    !!! warning "Disadvantage Examples"
        - Using makeshift equipment (-1 die)
        - Poor conditions (-1 die)
        - Working under pressure (-1 die)

=== "Boon & Bane"

    Alternative to Advantage/Disadvantage:
    
    - **Boon**: +1 to the roll
    - **Bane**: -1 to the roll
    - Multiple boons and banes cancel out

## Extended Tasks

Some tasks require multiple successes over time.

!!! info "Extended Task Procedure"
    1. Determine the number of successes needed
    2. Set the time interval between attempts
    3. Make repeated task rolls
    4. Track successes and time elapsed

### Extended Task Examples

| Task Type | Successes Needed | Time Interval | Skill Used |
|-----------|------------------|---------------|------------|
| Research Project | 6 | 1 day | Investigate |
| Repair Starship | 8 | 1 hour | Engineering |
| Plan Heist | 4 | 1 week | Tactics |
| Medical Treatment | 3 | 10 minutes | Medicine |

## Opposed Tasks

When characters work against each other directly.

```
Attacker: 2d6 + Characteristic + Skill
Defender: 2d6 + Characteristic + Skill

Higher total wins. Ties favor the defender.
```

!!! note "Opposed Task Examples"
    - **Stealth vs Perception**: Hiding from guards
    - **Deception vs Insight**: Lying convincingly  
    - **Athletics vs Athletics**: Wrestling match
    - **Pilot vs Pilot**: Starship chase

## Chain Tasks

Multiple related tasks that build on each other.

!!! success "Chain Task Benefits"
    - Success on previous task: +1 to next task
    - Exceptional success (Effect 6+): +2 to next task
    - Failure on previous task: -1 to next task

### Example Chain: Infiltrating a Facility

1. **Recon** (Investigate): Gather information about security
2. **Planning** (Tactics): Develop infiltration plan  
3. **Bypass Security** (Electronics): Disable alarms
4. **Stealth** (Stealth): Move through facility undetected
5. **Access Terminal** (Computer): Retrieve data

## Effect

The margin of success determines additional benefits.

| Effect | Result |
|--------|--------|
| 0      | Marginal success |
| 1-2    | Average success |
| 3-5    | Good success |
| 6+     | Exceptional success |

!!! tip "Using Effect"
    - **Combat**: Extra damage
    - **Social**: Additional information or favors
    - **Technical**: Faster completion or better quality
    - **Investigation**: More clues or deeper insights
